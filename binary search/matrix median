/*
    In this problem we are using binary search approach to find the median as 
    Step 1: Find the minimum and maximum element in the given array. By just traversing the first column, 
    we find the minimum element and by just traversing the last column, we find the maximum element.

    Step 2: Now find the middle element of the array one by one and check in the matrix how many elements 
    are present in the matrix.

    Three cases can occur:-

    If count ==  (r*c+1)/2 , so it may be the answer still we mark max as mid since we are not referring indices , 
    we are referring the elements and 5 elements can be smaller than 6 also and 7 also , 
    so to confirm we mark max as mid.
    If count<(r*c+1)/2 , we mark  min as mid+1 since curr element or elements before it cannot be the answer.
    If count>(r*c+1)/2 , we mark max as mid , since elements after this can only be the  answer now.
