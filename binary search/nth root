/*
In this implementation, we use the pow() function from the cmath library to calculate the nth root. 
We then check if the difference between the nth root and its rounded value is very small (less than 1e-9)
to determine if the nth root is an integer.
Note that we use abs() to take the absolute value of the difference since it 
could be negative if the rounded value is larger than the nth root. 
Finally, we output the result to the console.
